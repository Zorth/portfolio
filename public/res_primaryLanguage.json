      "description": "I'm Jasper Goens, a passionate graduate of Digital Arts & Entertainment with a specialization in VFX. As a digital artist, I blend creativity with a profound technical understanding to bring ideas to life. Whether delving into simulations, crafting technical 3D art, or navigating the realms of any 3D, I find joy in the diversity of digital expression.\n\nMy journey as an artist is fueled by a deep-seated love for storytelling across various media. I believe in the power of visuals to convey narratives that resonate with audiences. Every day, I dedicate myself to honing my skills, embracing the evolving landscape of digital arts, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.",
